# What is logit transform?

## Purpose
For transformation of proportion value in the range (0,1) into continuous value in the range (‑∞,∞).

## Description
Proportion (denoted as *p*) may, for example, be used as an outcome measure when we want to examine the prevalence of a disease at a given point in time. The fact that the range of proportion is restricted between 0 and 1 can be problematic. When *p* is close to 0 or close to 1, the standard error is artificially compressed, which leads us to overestimate the precision of the proportion estimate.
